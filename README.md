# RisQC Backend

## Requirements
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) with compose

## Setup
For the time being, you will need to grab a pre-processed database and place it in the `db-dump` directory  
The latest database dump can be grabbed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i-WBtBt1lQZejS5YClAxdPxeeun2ACNH/view?usp=sharing)

You can then start the database by running `docker-compose up -d`
